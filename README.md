# MRI and R Lab for an Undergraduate Neuroscience Course

These are the materials to run a single session of a lab in an undergraduate introduction to neuroscience course, which introduces student to R programing using structural MRI data. These course materials were adapted from the *Introduction to Neurohacking in R coursera course*. The link to those course materials can be found here: [https://github.com/muschellij2/Neurohacking].
