# MRI and R Lab for an Undergraduate Neuroscience

These are the materials to run a single session of a lab in an undergraduate introduction to neuroscience course. This lab exercise introduces students to R programing using structural MRI data. The only material required for this lab session is each student should have a computer capable of runing R. 

These materials were adapted from the *Introduction to Neurohacking in R* coursera course.
